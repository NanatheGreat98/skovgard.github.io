                        <h2>A little introduction</h2>
                        <p>As I mentioned, my name is Anna-art. I am 20 years old and I am from Hungary. I love to spend my time on drawing or bullet-journaling. Like Vani, I am also a small person and the people most of the time guess that I am younger thank at least 3-4 years than I am. As a fun fact I need to say that I started to collect cacti. </p>
                        <h2>About Multimedia Design and Communication</h2>
                        <p>The reason why I have choosed this course is because of my natural talent. I cannot imagine my life without using my creativity. Since I was born, I have always wanted to be a graphic designer.
                            In Multimedia Design and Communication, we learn the basic principles of designing and building responsive user surfaces for different devices. I have some theoretical lessons but since I am doing an AP degree, I have mostly practical assignments from week to week. I have learnt so many things within one month, thanks to this teaching method. We are usually working in teams because in the Danish education system the focus is on team working an collaborative skills.
                        </p>
                        <h2>My first day in Denmark</h2>
                        <p>When I arrived, I wanted to take my keys to my new dorm room. Our caretakers are open twice a day only for half an hour, so it was not a funny thing when early in the morning they said that I cannot get my keys because my contract starts from today and it can happen that my room need some renovations. Thank God at the end I can get my keys because the man remembered my dorm number, he changed the carpet the day before in it, so it was ready.
                            Later the day I found out that the glue which has been used to fix the new carpet is so smelly that I cannot sleep in the room, only if I open the door. And the funniest part was that I had no futures in the beginning. (I could get them the day after from the dorm’s furniture depot.)
                        </p>
                        <h2>After one month</h2>
                        <p>After one month I can tell that cycling is not funny at all. People are saying that Danish ones are cycling, but it is a lie. They are using e-bikes especially in my city because it is not flat. My city is the place where after each hill, there is another on which you need to cycle up. It is one of the most exhausting things I have ever done in my life.
                            My school is great. The Multimedia building is a new one and it’s beautiful and inspiring. I am not completely satisfied with some parts of the teaching because we did not spend the first month on quickly learning the basics. I am really missing that part, because I need to spend my whole free time on learning the basic techniques instead of learning them in school time. (It is not a unique problem, some of my classmates have the same feelings.)
                            I have made some new friends as well. It was quite surprising that my city is full of Hungarians. Once we went out with two other Hungarian girls and we started to discuss loudly on the street that we meet Hungarians everywhere. A random man was standing beside us and he just told that in Hungarian: “Yep… Hungarians are everywhere.” It was surprising!

                                <li>Always take a look at your bank account at your home country before you move. (I forgot to ask them whether I can use my card abroad or not. I was lucky, because I can use it.)</li>
