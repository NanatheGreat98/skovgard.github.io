                <h2>A little introduction</h2>
                <p>As I mentioned, my name is Vani. I am 19 years old and I am from Hungary. Basically, I am just spending half a year in Finland, as an Erasmus student. I am attending to a Scottish university beside this half year, so I have a lot of experience from each country.  I love animes and mangas and in my free time I often translating mangas into English. As a fun fact I need to say that I am small and no one ever believes that I am 19 years old.</p>
                <h2>About International Business Management</h2>
                <p>The reason why I have choosed this course is because of my aims. I have always dreamed about starting my own business, investing into something bigger. I would like to become a business woman one day who is not afraid of anything.
In International Business Management, we learn about the processes. We get a deeper insight to financial questions and politics. We also learn the skill of forecasting the future of the businesses. I have mainly theoretical lessons and my projects are pure paper work and research. We are mainly working in groups but within that, we always divide the things, so everyone is needed to work and put an effort into his/her part. Sometimes we have difficulties with the group works if someone is not willing to do anything. 
                </p>
                <h2>My first day in Finland</h2>
                <p>When I arrived, I realized that I forgot to pack the charger of my laptop. As an urgent situation, I needed another one… (Please look at Tips and Tricks!)
Later the day I got to know my flatmates whom I found a bit strange at first. They are from Czech Republic and was not willing to communicate in English which was weird because we are all Erasmus students. Therefore, I was terribly lonely in the beginning. It is frustrating if you cannot talk to anyone for a week.
                </p>
                <h2>After one month</h2>
                <p>After one month I can tell that Finland is cold. Two days ago, it was already snowing, but we have seen the Polar Lights as well. My life is full of adventures here. I have seen a bear, I am cycling to school even if the road is covered with ice at some points… 
My school is great. We have lunches for a really good price. But as I mentioned, life is sometimes not easy. In my group we have a girl who does not want to work on anything. We could not decide what should we do with her because we are not allowed to kick her out. (Even if she would deserve that…) 
After the lonely beginning, I made some good friendships and nowadays I often have someone to talk to if I am lonely. Also, I am currently applying to an internship at Disney, so wish good luck to me!

                <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always do a packing list about the most important things, before you move to your new home. (My charger…)</li>
                    <li>If you are travelling by plane, always pack bedding into the large suitcase and some warm clothes into your hand luggage. (When I arrived to Scotland, they lost my luggages and I did not have any warm clothes in that harsh Scottish weather.)</li>
