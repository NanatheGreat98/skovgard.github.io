                <h2>A little introduction</h2>
                <p>As I mentioned, my name is Lia. I am 20 years old and I am from Hungary. I love to socialize so that is how I always get into strange and exciting situations. As a fun fact I need to say that I am obsessed with makeups, especially with lipsticks. </p>
                <h2>About Hospitality Management</h2>
                <p>The reason why I have choosed this course is because of my family. My parents have a shop, so I was born into business so to say. Beside that I love to help customers out for a better experience.
                    In Hospitality Management, we learn how to lead a hotel. We learn everything about them, from the basics to the fanciest things. I have several theoretical lectures but for example on Thursdays I have a whole day, doing practical things like how to prepare a 5-starred menu in the kitchen or we taste wines and learn about their backgrounds. This day is always a funny one, you can see my wine tasting experience at the end of the website in comics.
                </p>
                <h2>My first day in Germany</h2>
                <p>When I arrived, I thought that I know the price of my rent. But as it turned out, I misunderstood something because it is twice as much as I knew. This can happen since I am sharing my place with another girl. (Please look at Tips and Tricks!)
                    This was the beginning. Later, I spent the rest of my day with running after my papers and documents inside the school. Thank God, I managed to get everything in time for the beginning of my lectures.
                </p>
                <h2>After one month</h2>
                <p>After one month I can tell that my school is full of drama. Something is always happening, like in a soap opera. We have a bar on top of the school, so we usually spend the evenings there. (You can imagine… every good story starts in a bar, like in How I Met Your Mother.) The bar has of course student friendly prices, anyone can afford it.
                    The only problem with the whole is that my school is in a little village and the closest big city is an hour by train. You can guess: the bar is indeed our one and only place where we can spend quality time. Once, someone called the police from the neighbourhood because of the noise at late night and since then, the bar closes at 10 p.m.
                    I like being here. I have always loved the international vibes, so I am really that person who fits here the best. I made a lot of new friends already, we have our small regular “gang”. For me, it was not a problem to settle in.

                <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you need to pay for your school, I advise you to avoid from any account numbers which is not officially your school’s, even if the university asks you to transfer the money to a different account. (They almost lost my money, it took a month to get it back!)</li>
                    <li>If you can make it, get a ride from your home to your new home. It is so much easier to take all your necessary things by car. (I was brought out with car by my father and it was the most comfortable way of moving in.)</li>
                    <li>Pay attention to the size of the school. The smaller the school, the faster the gossips spread. (It is just a friendly advice, nothing more.)</li>
